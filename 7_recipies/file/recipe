The file command is a file type guesser, that is, a command-line tool 
that tells you in words what kind of data a file contains. Unlike most 
GUI systems, command-line UNIX systems - with this program leading the 
charge - don't rely on filename extentions to tell you the type of a 
file, but look at the file's actual contents. This is, of course, more 
reliable, but requires a bit of I/O.
