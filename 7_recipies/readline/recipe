description="

 The GNU Readline library provides a set of functions for use by 
 applications that allow users to edit command lines as they are typed 
 in. Both Emacs and vi editing modes are available. The Readline 
 library includes additional functions to maintain a list of 
 previously-entered command lines, to recall and perhaps reedit those 
 lines, and perform csh-like history expansion on previous commands.

The history facilites are also placed into a separate library, 
the History library, as part of the build process. The History library 
may be used without Readline in applications which desire its capabilities.
