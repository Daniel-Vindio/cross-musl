description="

This is Expat, a C library for parsing XML, started by James Clark 
in 1997. Expat is a stream-oriented XML parser. This means that you 
register handlers with the parser before starting the parse. These 
handlers are called when the parser discovers the associated structures 
in the document being parsed. A start tag is an example of the kind of 
structures for which you may register handlers
