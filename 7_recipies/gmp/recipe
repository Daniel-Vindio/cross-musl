description="

GMP is a free library for arbitrary precision arithmetic, operating on 
signed integers, rational numbers, and floating-point numbers. There is 
no practical limit to the precision except the ones implied by the 
available memory in the machine GMP runs on. GMP has a rich set of 
functions, and the functions have a regular interface.

The main target applications for GMP are cryptography applications and 
research, Internet security applications, algebra systems, computational
algebra research, etc.
